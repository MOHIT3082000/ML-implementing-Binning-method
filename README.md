# ML-implementing-Binning-method
**Binning Method for ML Model**   Implemented binning techniques using KBinsDiscretizer to discretize continuous features. Applied equal-width and equal-frequency binning methods. Trained a Decision Tree Classifier model and evaluated performance using accuracy score and cross-validation to measure the impact of binning on model accuracy.
